## What are TIFs
Tax Increment Financing (TIF) districts are districts in Chicago that are created by the city with the goal of improving the lives and economy of people in the district. This is done through collecting property tax for a period of at minimum 23 years.

## Previous Work in This Area
We based our work on trying to expand the [Chicago 2022 TIF Data Project](https://github.com/philipayates/chicago2022TIF) created through a collaboration between the MCDC Project and The CivicLab

## Chicago TIF Accessibility Project
Our project focused on turning TIF financial data into an easily accessible digital format. There are two ways to access this data.

### Database Queries
We have set up a publicly accessible database and created tools to query into it.

### CSV File
Also available is a CSV file containing the same data in the public database. It is organized in the same way the the philipyayates data is organized

### How is the infrastructure set up and how do I access it
...It's an s3 bucket yadad
## How to query the database
...Grab that data!

## How is the CSV File Organized
Since our data is based off of the philipyayates database, the CSV shares the same format. The format is based on the table [here](https://github.com/philipayates/chicago2022TIF/?tab=readme-ov-file#what-are-these-variables)
